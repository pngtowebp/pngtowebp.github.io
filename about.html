                        <p>Welcome to <strong>PNG to WebP Converter</strong>, a suite of high-performance web tools designed for the modern internet. Our mission is to make file conversion fast, free, and—most importantly—private.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why We Are Different</h3>
                        <p>Unlike traditional online converters that require you to upload your files to a remote server, our tools work using <strong>Client-Side Rendering (CSR)</strong>. We utilize advanced technologies like WebAssembly (Wasm) and HTML5 Canvas to process your files directly in your browser.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Our Core Advantages</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Your files never leave your computer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> No upload or download wait times.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Professional-grade libraries like FFmpeg and UTIF.js ensure high-fidelity results.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Versatility for Every User</h3>
                        <p>Whether you are a photographer dealing with CR2 raw files, a designer needing to flatten a PSD, or a developer optimizing videos for the web, we have a tool built for you. Our technology stack ensures that high-quality conversion is accessible to everyone without the need for expensive software or compromising data security.</p>
                        
                        <p>We are constantly evolving and adding new formats to our library, maintaining our commitment to a serverless, user-centric experience.</p>
