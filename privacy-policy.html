                        <p>At Image Converter Tools, accessible from our website, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by our tools and how we use it.</p>
                        
                        <h3>1. Client-Side Processing and Security</h3>
                        <p>The core of our service is <strong>Client-Side Rendering (CSR)</strong>. Unlike traditional online converters, when you use our tools (e.g., TIFF to JPG, PSD to PNG, or MP4 to WebM), the processing happens entirely within your browser using JavaScript and WebAssembly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Your files are never uploaded to our servers.</strong> All transformations occur locally on your hardware. This ensures that your sensitive data and proprietary images never leave your computer.</p>
                        
                        <h3>2. No Data Collection Policy</h3>
                        <p>We do not collect personal identification information. Because the conversion process is handled by your browser, we do not store the images, videos, or documents you process. Any data used during conversion resides in your device's temporary memory (RAM) and is automatically cleared when you close the browser tab or refresh the page.</p>
                        
                        <h3>3. Log Files and Analytics</h3>
                        <p>We follow a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. The information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.</p>
                        
                        <h3>4. Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
                        <p>Like any other website, we may use "cookies" or third-party analytics (like Google Analytics) to understand website traffic and improve user experience. These cookies are used to store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the users' experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors' browser type and/or other information.</p>
                        
                        <h3>5. Third-Party Privacy Policies</h3>
                        <p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other advertisers or websites. Thus, we are advising you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information. It may include their practices and instructions about how to opt-out of certain options.</p>
                        
                        <h3>6. Children's Information</h3>
                        <p>Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity. We do not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13.</p>

                        <h3>7. Contact Us</h3>
